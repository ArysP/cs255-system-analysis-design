## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

## What did you do particularly well?
I dont have much experience with design documents and business requirements. Seeing as it's my first time I would imagine I didn't do anything particularly well. I can say from what I did, my best would probably be my writing over the chart designs.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
As I said before I think my chart/diagrams have a lot of room for improvements. A big one I can already see is the need to include more actors in my use case diagrams. I only had two and I don't think it does the entire system justice.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Luckily the "client" knew exactly what they wanted so it was easy to translate the initial meetings info into a system. It's very important to consider the user's needs because in a captalist society, the users demands are what drives a system. Without users, there wouldnt be the need for a system, or a designer for that matter.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
From the famous words of Einstein, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough". Basically try to keep things as simple as possible. When there are a lot of moving parts, the more complex a system is, the harder it becomes to add onto, refine, or fix, and all three of those things are very important for the longevity of a system.
